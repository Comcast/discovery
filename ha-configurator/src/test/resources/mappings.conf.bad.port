# Port mappings.  Each entry in this mapping file is keyed on an external
# port, followed by a regular expression.  If a registration path matches a
# regular expression, it will be routed via the given external port.  Entries
# are parsed in a top down fashion.  The first matching expression will be
# used.  No catch-all rules is implied, although one can be used.
#
# These mappings are only used to configure HAProxy and should not be confused
# with the filters passed to the discovery client, which are Ant style globs
# and not regular expressions.
#
#format is:
